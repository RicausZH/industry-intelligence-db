3. Architectural Principles
3.1 Core Design Principles
Data Integrity First: All architecture decisions prioritize data integrity and consistency. The system employs transaction-based processing with automatic rollback capabilities to ensure data corruption never occurs.

Source Separation: Each data source maintains its own dedicated table structure while unified views provide cross-source analytical capabilities. This approach prevents data source conflicts and enables independent processing.

Batch Processing Optimization: All data processing operations utilize batch processing with configurable batch sizes (default: 1,000 records) to optimize database performance and memory usage.

Pre-loaded Mapping Strategy: Country and indicator mappings are pre-loaded into memory before processing to eliminate database lookups during CSV processing, significantly improving performance.

Validation at Every Layer: Input validation, data sanitization, and cross-source validation occur at multiple levels to ensure data quality and system security.

3.2 Scalability Principles
Horizontal Scaling Ready: The architecture supports horizontal scaling through connection pooling, optimized indexing, and materialized views for complex queries.

Memory-Efficient Processing: Large CSV files are processed using streaming parsers with controlled memory usage to handle files exceeding system memory capacity.

Incremental Processing: The system supports incremental data updates and can process partial datasets without requiring full reprocessing.

4. Data Flow Architecture
4.1 Data Ingestion Flow
The data ingestion process follows a standardized pattern across all three data sources:

Data Acquisition: Source CSV files are downloaded from authoritative endpoints
Mapping Pre-load: Country and indicator mappings are loaded into memory
Validation Processing: Each row undergoes validation and sanitization
Industry Classification: Indicators are classified into appropriate industry categories
Batch Insertion: Validated data is inserted in 1,000-record batches
Transaction Commit: Successful batches are committed with rollback on errors
